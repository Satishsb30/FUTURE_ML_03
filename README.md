# FUTURE_ML_03 – Resume / Candidate Screening System

## Project Overview
Hiring teams often receive hundreds of resumes for a single job role.
Manually screening these resumes is time-consuming, inconsistent, and
error-prone.

This project implements a machine learning–based resume screening system
that automatically analyzes resume text, compares it with a given job
description, and ranks candidates based on role relevance.

The system helps recruiters shortlist candidates faster and identify
missing or weak skills.

---

## Problem Statement
Manual resume screening slows down the hiring process and makes it
difficult to consistently match candidates with job requirements.

---

## Solution Approach
The system follows these steps:
- Clean and preprocess resume text
- Define a job description for a target role
- Convert resumes and job description into numerical features
- Calculate similarity scores between resumes and the job description
- Rank candidates based on relevance score
- Identify missing skills for each candidate

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Cosine Similarity  
- Google Colab  

---

## Key Features
- Resume text preprocessing using NLP techniques
- Job description parsing
- Resume-to-job similarity scoring
- Candidate ranking based on role fit
- Identification of missing or weak skills

---

## Output
The system produces:
- A relevance score for each resume
- A ranked list of candidates
- Skill gap information to support hiring decisions

---

## Business Impact
This resume screening system reduces manual effort for recruiters,
improves shortlisting speed, and enables more consistent and data-driven
hiring decisions.
